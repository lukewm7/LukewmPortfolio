    "text": "Hi Everyone!\nI’m currently a Masters of Data Science Student at Willamette University in Portland Oregon. After graduation I’ll be moving to Boulder Colorado to join the Mission and Process Analytics team at Ball Aerospace as a Data Scientist. I attended Willamette University for my undergraduate degree as well where I received a BS in Data Science and a BA in Economics with a minor in Computer Science. While at Willamette University, I served as a captain on the baseball team and was named a Baseball All-American in 2021 as well as an Academic All-American in 2021 and 2022. When I’m not nerding out over stats on baseballsavant or fivethirtyeight, you can find me on the slopes skiing or wading in a river fly fishing."
